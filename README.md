Pokemon Splice 
Pokemon Splice is a pokemon Fan Game made by Thundaga/xCamero for the Summer Game Jam 6. It is set in the Stacona region, a region where 2 teams (Bio and Mech) have created
lots of new Pokemon regional forms, along with a couple of evolutions for existing mons. The forms are nature based or technology based, as per the teams. 
There are also 3 mons, being the starter and 2 legendaries, that have Arceus esque forms using cellulose, the substitute for plates for them. And 3 or so new abilities and that


Credits also go to Voltseon, Broskiddo and Tristantine_The_Great for sprites and code, and literally anyone else in the credits of the game idk
